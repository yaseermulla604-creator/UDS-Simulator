# UDS-Simulator
The UDS/CAN GUI app, built in Python 3.12.4+, streamlines automotive ECU diagnostics using UDS and CAN protocols. With a `pywebview` GUI, it supports services like 0x19, 0x22, and 0x2E. Key classes include CAN, CAN_TP, UDS, and EventManager. Install dependencies, run `r.bat` to launch. Extend via new SID classes or LIN integration.
