This documentation covers the implementation and usage of a Svelte component that displays a list of requests stored in a `requestStack`, processes the status mask data, and allows users to select a specific request for further processing.

## Overview

The component renders a list of buttons, each representing a request from the `requestStack`. It processes the "Status Mask" field of each request to display it in a formatted hexadecimal string. When a button is clicked, the corresponding request is selected by setting the `requestIndex`.

### Key Features
- **Processing Status Mask**: Converts the status mask from a dictionary of boolean values to a hexadecimal string.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Each request in the `requestStack` is displayed as a button, and clicking a button selects that request for further actions.

## Component Breakdown

### 1. Import Statements

```javascript
import { Button } from "flowbite-svelte";
import { requestStack, requestIndex } from "../../store/store";
```

- **`Button`**: A component from Flowbite Svelte used to create styled buttons.
- **`requestStack`**: A Svelte store that holds an array of requests.
- **`requestIndex`**: A Svelte store that tracks the index of the selected request.

### 2. Function: `processStatusMask`

```javascript
function processStatusMask(statusMaskDict) {
  const statusMaskBits = Object.keys(statusMaskDict)
    .reverse()
    .map((key) => (statusMaskDict[key] ? "1" : "0"))
    .join("");
  const statusMaskInt = parseInt(statusMaskBits, 2);
  const statusMaskHex = statusMaskInt
    .toString(16)
    .padStart(2, "0")
    .toUpperCase();

  return `0x${statusMaskHex}`;
}
```

- **Purpose**: This function takes a dictionary of status mask values (with keys as status labels and boolean values) and converts it into a 2-byte hexadecimal string.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Reverse and Map**: The dictionary keys are reversed and mapped to "1" or "0" based on their boolean values.
  2. **Convert to Integer**: The binary string is converted into an integer.
  3. **Format as Hexadecimal**: The integer is converted to a hexadecimal string, padded to 2 bytes, and formatted as uppercase.

### 3. Rendering the Buttons

```html
<div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
  {#each $requestStack as request, index}
    <Button
      color="alternative"
      on:click={() => {
        requestIndex.set(index);
        console.log(request);
      }}
    >
      {#each Object.entries(request) as [key, value], i (key)}
        <span>
          {key}:
          {#if key === "Status Mask"}
            {processStatusMask(value)}
          {:else}
            {value}
          {/if}
        </span>
        {#if i < Object.entries(request).length - 1}
          <div class="mx-2">|</div>
        {/if}
      {/each}
    </Button>
  {/each}
</div>
```

- **`<Button>` Component**: Each request is wrapped inside a `Button` component, which is styled using Flowbite Svelte.
- **Button Click Event**: When a button is clicked, the corresponding `requestIndex` is updated to the button's index, and the request's details are logged to the console.
- **Display Logic**:
  - **Key-Value Pairs**: Each key-value pair of the request is displayed inside the button.
  - **Status Mask Processing**: If the key is "Status Mask," the `processStatusMask` function is used to convert and display the status mask in hexadecimal format.
  - **Separator**: A separator (`|`) is displayed between key-value pairs for clarity.

## How to Use This Component

1. **Displaying Requests**: The component automatically displays all requests stored in the `requestStack`. Each request is represented by a button, and the status mask is processed into a readable hexadecimal format.

2. **Selecting a Request**:
   - Clicking on a button selects the corresponding request by setting the `requestIndex`.
   - The selected request index can be used elsewhere in the application to perform further actions based on the selected request.

3. **Processing Status Masks**:
   - The component handles the conversion of status masks from a dictionary of boolean values to a hexadecimal string, simplifying the display and readability of status information.

## Example Use Case

This component can be used in applications where multiple requests are processed and need to be displayed to the user, such as in diagnostic tools or data processing applications. The ability to interactively select and view processed status masks provides users with a clear and concise way to interpret the data.

## Conclusion

This component efficiently manages and displays a list of requests with processed status masks. Its interactive design, powered by Flowbite Svelte, makes it easy to integrate into a wide range of applications.
